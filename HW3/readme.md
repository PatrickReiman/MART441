My biggest successes were the fact that I finally managed to how condense my buttonChecker() by utilizing arrays. It was the most difficult part and was giving me a lot of trouble trying to find a solution. I tried many different routes to circumvent my own coding, but ended up renaming certain elements and utilzing an array which really cut down on space. It's hard to describe how I overcame the issues since I kind of just did by experimenting with various things when what I was doing wasn't working. I remembered a bit about arrays from other programming languages so I had a decent idea that they could work if I managed to get it to work. My only other main issue was that of condensing the huge swaths of [mostly] repeated text in the javascript file. However, I would need to work from the ground up to redo it from its current state and thus settled on it being "good enough for now". I did utilize some for loops to at least eliminate sections that were repetitive and easily replacable with something simplier.
