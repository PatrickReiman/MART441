Plan:
Same game as before

fix timer so that you can't click any other cards during that short time (disable all interaction, save which are matched, then re-enable interaction on unmatched ones)
- do this by loading correct answers into array (using tempArray), disabling button class on wrong, then selectively re-enabling all buttons except the correct answer ones

on startpage allow option to select previous users or make new user (MAKE SURE TO NOT ALLOW SOMEONE TO START A GAME WITH BLANK VALUES OR GIVE NEGATIVE AGE)

ADD A DELAY ON PRESENTING THE RESTART BUTTON ONCE YOU GET ALL ANSWERS CORRECT (AND ALSO HIDING ALL BUTTONS)

on endpage:
- number of attempts (this game)
- number of attempts (all time)
- number of times loaded into game (i.e. got to the matching screen)
- first name, last name, age (make it a number only text box [i know it's possible])

attempts is measured how many times you tried to match cards (hence the minimum number of attempts can be 6 as there are 12 cards)
