Plan:
Same game as before
fix timer so that you can't click any other cards during that short time (disable all interaction, save which are matched, then re-enable interaction on unmatched ones)
on startpage allow option to select previous users or make new user
on endpage:
- number of attempts (this game)
- number of attempts (all time)
- number of times loaded into game (i.e. got to the matching screen)
- first name, last name, age (make it a number only text box [i know it's possible])
