                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I'm currently a senior in the neuroscience program at University of Montana and work in Michael
                    Kavanaugh's lab as an undergraduate research assistant. I also am apart of the Neuroclub that is
                    on campus and have volunteered at events where we taught people of all ages interesting facts about
                    neuroscience. 
                </p>
                <p>Currently I hope to graduate this coming spring (of 2024) then garner some work experience before
                    applying to graduate school and working on research about Multiple Sclerosis.
                </p>
                <p>My main inspriation for going into neuroscience was that I was fascinated with the brain and how it 
                    worked and the possibility of people being able to possibly fix and change things that were wrong with
                    the brain. This is the main reason why I am focusing on Multiple Sclerosis as I have the goal of at
                    least being on the team that "cures" the disease.

                    <div class="myInterests-item">Often when someone is trying to explain a concept to someone who does not understand said concept they will write paragraphs upon paragraphs of text to try and get their point across. I feel this has the opposite effect as most people don't like to read huge blocks of text (like this one) and broken up chunks of text that have highlights (bold, italics, etc.) for important context would be much better. I think this mindset is a holdover from conservation as we often go off on tangents or talk about unrelated things when speaking, however, this doesn't work well in written text. If one is hell-bent on explaining things in big chunks of text the best way to do it is by explaining concepts that may be relevant to understanding a more complex topic first. An example could be that you need to explain the idea of voltage and current to someone before they can understand something like action potentials. So instead of just assuming they know the content, you first give a short, concise explanation of those concepts before you jump into the more complex topic. </div>
